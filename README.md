```

### Launch a command on host device

```rust
use adb_client::AdbTcpConnexion;
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let mut connexion = AdbTcpConnexion::new(Ipv4Addr::from([127,0,0,1]), 5037).unwrap();
connexion.shell_command(None, vec!["df", "-h"]);
```

### Get available ADB devices

```rust
use adb_client::AdbTcpConnexion;
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let mut connexion = AdbTcpConnexion::new(Ipv4Addr::from([127,0,0,1]), 5037).unwrap();
connexion.devices();
```

## Rust binary
